# Beta bursts extraction
An algorithm used to extract beta bursts from EEG/MEG data developed as part of my Master's Thesis at McGill University.

Beta bursts are EEG biomarkers in the beta frequency band that are important in voluntary movement, and more specifically, detecting intention of movement, motor learning, and motor performance. Correctly identifying these bursts as well as modulating them externally through non-invasive brain stimulation can improve movement production in populations exhibiting motor deficits such as elderly individuals, Parkinson's patients, and stroke survivors.

If you are interested in understanding how this algorithm works, check out this PowerPoint [presentation](<./burst analysis/Beta burst analysis algorithm.pdf>).

If you want to use this algorithm, check out the [beta bursts steps](<./burst analysis/Beta bursts steps.pdf>). Please note that data preprocessing was done using the Brainstorm software, but other software such as EEGLAB can also be used.

If you are curious about my thesis and the results obtained, check out [my thesis](<./burst analysis/Thesis.pdf>).
