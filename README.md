# Beta-bursts-extraction
An algorithm that extracts beta bursts from EEG or MEG data developed as part of my Master's Thesis at McGill University.

If you are interested in understanding how this algorithm works, check out the PowerPoint presentation Beta_burst_analysis.pptx.

If you want to use this algorithm, check out the Beta_bursts_steps.docx. Please note that data preprocessing was done using the Brainstorm software, but other software such as EEGLAB can also be used.

If you are curious about my thesis and the results obtained, check out Thesis.pdf.
